### Explanation of the Folders

- **`main.go`**: The entry point for your application where you initialize the Gin router, connect to the database, and start the server.

- **`config/`**: This folder contains configuration-related files, such as environment variables and database connection settings.

- **`controllers/`**: This folder is where the HTTP handlers reside. Controllers are responsible for processing incoming HTTP requests, calling the appropriate services, and returning responses.

- **`models/`**: Contains GORM models, which represent your database schema. Each model maps to a database table and defines the fields and relationships.

- **`repositories/`**: Responsible for database access and query operations. Instead of having database queries directly in controllers or services, the repository layer encapsulates all the data access logic, providing cleaner separation of concerns.

- **`services/`**: This is where the business logic lives. Services call repositories to interact with the database, process data, and apply business rules.

- **`routes/`**: This folder defines the routes/endpoints for the API. Each module (e.g., users) can have its own route file.

- **`middlewares/`**: Custom middlewares that handle logic like authentication, authorization, and logging.

- **`utils/`**: Contains utility functions or helpers that might be used across the application, such as JWT handling, password hashing, or validation functions.

- **`docs/`**: If you're using an API documentation tool like Swagger, this folder can contain the OpenAPI specifications or related documentation.
